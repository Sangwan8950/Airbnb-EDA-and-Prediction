<h2 align="center">Airbnb EDA and Prediction</h2>


<h3 align="left">Objective</h3>
<p align="left">The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction on an Airbnb dataset using a random forest regressor. The project aims to gain insights into the factors influencing Airbnb listings and develop a prediction model to estimate the rental price of listings based on their attributes. By conducting EDA and building a random forest regression model, the project seeks to provide valuable information for both hosts and guests, allowing hosts to optimize their listings and helping guests make informed decisions when selecting accommodations.</p>
